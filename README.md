# Eatstagram

Eatstagram is a photo sharing application that focuses on food contents and targets mobile users.

People can upload food photos to our service and share them with their followers whether it's their own or from a favorite restaurant. They can also view, comment and like posts from other users.

Eatstagram was created by Batch 12 students of Uplift Code Camp with the help of one of their Instructors.
